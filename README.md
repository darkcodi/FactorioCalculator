It's a WASM web-application that allows you to calculate needed resources/factories for your base in factory games like Satisfactory and Factorio.
This tool supports adding custom resources/factories.

NOTE: The entire web app works as a static website, hosted on Github Pages. There is NO backend, it runs only in your browser! :)
